# Pipelines Templates

These pipelines and pipeline templates are meant to help you explore some of the capabilities of Spinnaker Pipelines.

You can read more about Pipeline Templates [**here**](https://github.com/spinnaker/dcd-spec/blob/master/PIPELINE_TEMPLATES.md).


## Getting Started

It is recommended you start with `generic/` before moving on to more advanced, provider specific templates located in the other directories (like `gcp/`).

Generally, you will have an SSH tunnel for connecting to Spinnaker and another terminal for using the tools instance. If you have performed the advanced capstan configuration you would not need the tunnel. The directions do not assume the advanced configuration.

### GCP

In a new terminal connect to your `halyard-tunnel` instance:

```bash
$ gcloud compute --project "[PROJECT_NAME]" ssh --zone "[ZONE]" "[INSTANCE_NAME]"
```

Templates are published using [**roer**](https://github.com/spinnaker/roer). It should already be installed and configured on the instance.

```bash
$ roer pipeline-template publish ./path/to/template.yml
```

There are instructions for each template on how to create a template based pipeline in each template's respective directory.

When no using Roer, the future api tool called [**Spin**](https://github.com/spinnaker/spin) will be used/
