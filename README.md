What is a [Capstan?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_(nautical))?
Packaging of open source for creating Containerized CICD Environments.

if you are here you are interested in:
- Using Kubernetes
- Using Spinnaker
- Using a Cloud Iaas
- Not wanting to figure out how to set all that up yourself on some IaaS
- Just want to deploy containerized apps without all the fuss of doing all that set-up
- Or not worried about apps but want to see a packaging of various concepts together...
