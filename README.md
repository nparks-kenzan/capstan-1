What is a [Capstan?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_(nautical))?
Packaging of open source for creating Containerized CICD Environments.

## Motivation

Microservices, containers, canary, cloud, Continuous Delivery oh my! With all the myriad of technologies processes and architectures, where does a developer even begin? CAPSTAN attempts to bring all those components together to where a developer can be immediately productive developing software on a containerized continuous software delivery platform in the cloud.

So, if you are interested in:
- Using Kubernetes
- Using Spinnaker
- Using a Cloud Iaas
- Not wanting to figure out how to set all that up yourself on some IaaS
- Just want to deploy containerized apps without all the fuss of doing all that set-up
- Or not worried about apps but want to see a packaging of various concepts together...

Oh, we have a solution for you!
